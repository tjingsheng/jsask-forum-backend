31,2,2023-01-25 06:00:04+00,Emoji,"An emoji (/…™Ààmo äd íiÀê/ i-MOH-jee; plural emoji or emojis[1]) is a pictogram, logogram, ideogram or smiley embedded in text and used in electronic messages and web pages. The primary function of emoji is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation.[2] Examples of emoji are üòÇ, üòÉ, üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, üåç, üå¶Ô∏è, ü•ñ, üöó, üì±, üéâ, ‚ù§Ô∏è, ‚úÖ, and üèÅ. Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, common objects, places and types of weather, and animals. They are much like emoticons, except emoji are pictures rather than typographic approximations; the term 'emoji'"" in the strict sense refers to such pictures which can be represented as encoded characters but it is sometimes applied to messaging stickers by extension.[3] Originally meaning pictograph the word emoji comes from Japanese e (Áµµ ''picture'') + moji (ÊñáÂ≠ó ''character''); the resemblance to the English words emotion and emoticon is purely coincidental.[4] The ISO 15924 script code for emoji is Zsye.""",0

24,25,2023-01-24 13:48:24+00,Getting Started With Redux,"Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.",0
